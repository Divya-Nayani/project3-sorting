Business case:

People in my city are getting more and more concerned about the impact they make on the environment. 
We are ready to sort the waste our families produce and would like to dispose of it in a more eco-friendly manner. 
Unfortunately, in most parts of the city, there are no special containers for separate garbage collection and there is very little information about 
the eco stations and services nearby. I personally order a paid eco taxi service that comes to my place and picks up the garbage that we’ve collected. 
However, the service only collects a limited number of kinds of waste, and I still have a question about what to do with other types. 
As a customer, I would like to have a tool (preferably an app, but a website also will do) that will allow me to see on the map all eco services 
available in my area. The app should have information about the types of waste each eco service accepts, payment conditions (free of charge or paid),
delivery options, rating of the service, and the opportunity to ask a question. As it can be hard sometimes to define the type of waste you have 
(different types of plastic would be a classical example) a good extra feature could be the complete list of different types of waste with 
recommendations on how to define each type (if it isn’t evidently marked) and photo examples of each type.
